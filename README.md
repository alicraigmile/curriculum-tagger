# Curriculum Tagger

While browsing around the web, and you find a page that teaches you somethign new, tag the page so that others can learn that something too.

With a couple of clicks you can map web pages directly to one or more Curricula (e.g. National Curriculum, Curriculum for Excellence, UK Funcational Skills, etc) and help Teachers and Students alike find great resources for their own teaching and studies.

Curriculum tagger is available in Chrome and Firefox favours.

## Chrome Extension

See [the README for the Chrome Extension](chrome-extension/README.md)

## Firefox Addon

WIP: Currently the Firefox Extension only supports viewing tags.

## Curriculum Tagger Web Application

Under the bonnet, Curriculum Tagger is a ruby/sinatra application. It's this that the browser extensions communicate with - and which stores and retreives data from the database.
