# Curriculum Tagger

While browsing around the web, and you find a page that teaches you somethign new, tag the page so that others can learn that something too.

With a couple of clicks you can map web pages directly to one or more Curricula (e.g. National Curriculum, Curriculum for Excellence, UK Funcational Skills, etc) and help Teachers and Students alike find great resources for their own teaching and studies.

Curriculum tagger is available in Chrome and Firefox favours.

## Chrome Extension

See [the README for the Chrome Extension](chrome-extension/README.md)

## Firefox Addon

WIP: Currently the Firefox Extension only supports viewing tags.

See [the README for the Firefox Addon](firefox-addon/README.md)

## Curriculum Tagger Web Application

Under the bonnet, Curriculum Tagger is a ruby/sinatra application. It's this that the browser extensions communicate with - and which stores and retreives data from the database.

See [the README for the Web Application](app/README.md)

## Data

We have currently map pahes to the the UK National Curriculum and the Curriculum for Excellence (Scotland). We're in the process of adding UK Functional Skills too. Thanks to the BBC for publishing [the data](https://github.com/BBC/curriculum-data) behind [BBC Bitesize](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/).

## How to get involved

I'm open to any and all offers of help. I'd particularly value more Curriculum data - about K12 in the USA for example  or indeed any Curriculum we don't support.

If you're a #linkeddata GURU to a Ruby Ninja then your skills would certainly come in helpful too.

Most importantly - you can get involved by tagging web pages of course!
