# Curriculum Tagger Web Application

Curriculum Tagger is a rack based web application and so you can configure it to run in any of the usual ways (e.g. heroku or apache-passenger). It works well started on the commandline, running on a dedicated port too.

### Setup

``` bash
./setup.sh
```

### To run on a dedicated port

``` bash
./run.sh
```
